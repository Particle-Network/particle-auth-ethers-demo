# Particle Auth Next.js & ethers V6

‚ö°Ô∏è Basic demo application using `@particle-network/auth-core` to initiate social login and send transactions. This is a lower-level library and powers `@particle-network/auth-core-modal` - most additional functionality beyond the aforementioned (login and transaction execution) will need to be built by the developer implementing this library.

This app allows you to log in using social logins and interact with the Ethereum Sepolia and Base Sepolia testnets by displaying account information and sending a transfer transaction to an address you can input in the UI. 

> The Next application is within the `particle-next-starter` directory.

> üõ†Ô∏è Try the demo: [Particle Auth Next.js demo](https://particle-next-starter.vercel.app/)

Built using:

- **Next.js**
- **Particle Auth Core**
- **ethers.js V6.x.x**
- **TypeScript**
- **`src/` directory**
- **App router**
- **Tailwind CSS**

## üîë Particle Auth Core

Particle Auth Core, a component of Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service, enables seamless onboarding to an application-embedded MPC-TSS/AA wallet facilitated by social login, such as Google, GitHub, email, phone number, etc. - as an alternative to Particle Auth, the Auth Core SDK comes with more control over the modal itself, application-embedded popups rather than redirects, and so on.
